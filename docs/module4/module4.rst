Module 4: Server Technologies and Custom Signature Sets
===================================================

This lab will examine the use of server technologies feature to automatically build signature sets based on the server-side application frameworks, web servers and operating systems.  

Leveraging programmability to deploy security policies and/or adhere to best
practices during an applicationâ€™s lifecycle reduces the operational
(e.g. time and money) cost of a defense in depth strategy.  Programmatic
workflows can be developed and deployed for specific security use cases,
and integrated into the SDLC process, allowing for the protection of an
application to iterate in parallel with the development of the application.

These exercises will feature the following topics.

* Create, modify and assign an ASM policy

To perform the steps required in the lab, `Postman`_ will be used from the
Linux jump box.

.. NOTE:: All work for this lab will be performed exclusively from the
   linux jumphost.  No software installation or interaction with your
   local system is required.
