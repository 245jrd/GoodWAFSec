This lab will demonstrate how to secure applications programmatically
using a BIG-IP's iControl based REST API.

Leveraging programmability to deploy security policies and/or adhere to best
practices during an applicationâ€™s lifecycle reduces the operational
(e.g. time and money) cost of a defense in depth strategy.  Programmatic
workflows can be developed and deployed for specific security use cases,
and integrated into the SDLC process, allowing for the protection of an
application to iterate in parallel with the development of the application.

These exercises will feature the following topics.

* Create, modify and assign an ASM policy

**Lab Guide**

To perform the steps required in the lab, `Postman`_ will be used from the
Linux jump box.

Prior to beginning the exercises, it is recommended to review the :doc: `/labinfo/labinfo.rst`.
